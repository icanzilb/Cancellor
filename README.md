# Cancellor

Bind multiple cancellables to the lifetime of a view controller.

## Usage

Import **Cancellor** and subscribe your publishers inside an `ownedCancellables` block. When your view controller is dismissed any active subscriptions will get cancelled automatically. 

```swift
import Cancellor

class MyViewController: UIViewController {
  override func viewDidLoad() {
    ownedCancellables {
      myPublisher1.sink(...)
      myPublisher2.sink(...)
      myPublisher3.assign(to: ..., on: ...)
    }
  }
}
```

## Import

Add the following dependency to your **Package.swift** file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/icanzilb/Cancellor, from: "0.1")
```

## License

Cancellor is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more info.
